## Project Structure

The application follows a modular structure to maintain clarity and scalability:

.github/workflows   → Deployment automation  
backup/             → Archived development versions  
css/                → Stylesheets  
js/                 → JavaScript functionality  
media/              → Images and videos  
html-f1/            → Formula 1 pages  
html-motogp/        → MotoGP pages  
html-leman24h/      → Le Mans pages  
html-nascar/        → NASCAR pages  
index.html          → Landing page  
login.html          → Login interface  
after_login.html    → Category feed  

This structured organization helps reduce file congestion and improves maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for structural design  
- CSS3 for layout styling and responsiveness  
- JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic behavior  
- Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration  
- GitHub Pages for deployment

## Development Approach

The development of Nightscape followed a structured and incremental frontend methodology. The process began with identifying core functional requirements such as category-based media organization, smooth navigation, multimedia support, and basic user interaction features.

The design phase involved planning layout consistency, modular segmentation of pages, and a unified visual theme. Implementation was carried out using semantic HTML, modular CSS, and lightweight JavaScript to ensure readability and maintainability.

Testing was conducted across different screen sizes to verify responsiveness, layout stability, and smooth media rendering.

## Security Considerations

Although Nightscape is a frontend application, basic validation mechanisms were implemented:

- Email format validation using regular expressions  
- Password validation rules  
- Controlled navigation flow  
- Modular file structure for better maintainability  

Future improvements may include backend authentication, secure session handling, and database integration.

## Application Flow

1. Landing Page – Entry point with hero section  
2. Login Interface – Email validation and controlled access  
3. Category Feed – Motorsport selection  
4. Gallery Page – Masonry-style media presentation  
5. Pin Page – Individual media interaction and related content  

---

## Academic Context

Nightscape was developed as part of the M.Sc Cyber Security (Web Design and Development – CSE5009) laboratory coursework at Amity University Bengaluru (2025–2026).

The project demonstrates practical implementation of frontend development principles, UI structuring, modular architecture, and collaborative version-controlled development.

---

## Future Scope

Potential enhancements include:

- Backend authentication system  
- Database-driven dynamic content loading  
- Search and filtering functionality  
- User profile management  
- Secure session handling  
- Advanced UI animations and transitions
